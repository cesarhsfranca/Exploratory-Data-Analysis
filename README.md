# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1".
As part of the project eight files are provided as below indicated:

The README.md (this one);
plot1.R - Code to generate the plot1;
plot1.png - The plot1 generated by the code immediately above;
plot2.R - Code to generate the plot2;
plot2.png - The plot2 generated by the code immediately above;
plot3.R - Code to generate the plot3;
plot3.png - The plot3 generated by the code immediately above;
plot4.R - Code to generate the plot4;
plot4.png - The plot4 generated by the code immediately above.

According to your convinience the codes to generate each plot can be downloaded from the project to run either in R or RStudio. Personaly I
prefer RStudio that allows me to see the code running step by step and see the results of each command. Additionally for those that want to
add more prints is easy to see the results instantly.
